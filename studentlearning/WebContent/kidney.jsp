<h1 style="color:#0000FF ">How do you dissolve kidney stones naturally?</h1>
<center><img id="pill" src="images/kidney.jpg"  height="430px" alt=""/></center>
<p id="para">Youâ€™re experiencing severe abdominal pain thatâ€™s radiating to your lower back. You also notice blood in your urine and a persistent need to urinate, even though you can only urinate small amounts at a time. You have a history of kidney stones and are pretty sure you are experiencing them again. Not wanting to use medications or surgery to treat your kidney stones, you start to look for successful home remedies that dissolve kidney stones naturally and fast.</p><br/>
<center><img id="pill" src="images/kidney1.jpg"  height="300px "width="500px" alt=""/></center>
<h3 style="color:black;"><b>Structure of kidney</b></h3>
<center><img id="pill" src="images/kidney2.jpg"  height="200px "width="400px" alt=""/></center>
<p id="para">We have two kidneys. These are located in the lumbar region, a little below the waist, oriented towards the back. Each kidney weighs about 150 grams and is about the size of an adult fist. They are bean-shaped and reddish brown in colour.</p>
<h3 style="color:black;"><b>Function of kidney</b></h3>
<ul>
<li style="color:black">Activation of Vitamin D absorption.</li>
<li style="color:black">Blood pressure regulation.</li>
<li style="color:black">Elimination of metabolic wastes.</li>
<li style="color:black">Maintaining the fluid balance.</li>
<li style="color:black">Stimulation of red blood cell production.</li>
<li style="color:black">Maintaining the electrolyte balance.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="color:black;"><b>Factors Affecting Kidney Functions</b></h3>
<ul>
<li style="color:black">Cooked food.</li>
<li style="color:black">Diabetes.</li>
<li style="color:black">High Blood Pressure</li>
<li style="color:black">Lower urinary tract infection, e.g. bladder infections, ascending</li>
<li style="color:black">Kidney damage as a side effect of medication, particularly</li>
<li style="color:black">painkillers taken for headache, backache, joint pains etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="color:black;"><b>Symptom of a weak kidney</b></h3>
<li style="color:black">Blood passed out with urine</li>
<li style="color:black">Pain in the kidney area, kidney/ureter stone</li>
<li style="color:black">Pain or burning when passing urine, indicating an infection</li>
<li style="color:black">Tiredness, particularly in the evening.</li>
<li style="color:black">Change in the frequency and quantity of urine passed</li>
<h3 style="color:black;"><b>Kidney Cleanse Procedure</b></h3>
<p id="para">Kidney cleanse is a procedure that is used to cleanse the kidneys from within, by removing deeply embedded toxic wastes from the blood and kidneys. Kidney cleansing also dissolves kidney stones and passes them through urine in microscopically dissolved form.</p>
<h3 style="color:black;"><b>Ingredients</b></h3>
<p id="para">1. Tea (kaadha) made from corn silk (bhutte ka baal) â€“ fresh or dried. The corn silk should ideally be dried in sunlight. If dried,it can be preserved for a long time. Washing the dried corn silk prior to use is not necessary because dust and impurities can be removed by sedimentation and decantation during use;</p>
<center><img id="pill" src="images/kidney3.jpg"  height="300px" alt=""/></center><br/>
<p id="para"> or </br>
2. Tea made from parsley (green coriander like vegetable, available in big cities) leaves, costing about Rs 400 per kg. Parsley is to be used fresh. Rinse in water before boiling. It should be strongly fragrant, otherwise it has partially lost its active ingredients. It
can be stored in the refrigerator for four to five days;</p>
<center><img id="pill" src="images/kidney4.jpg"  height="300px" alt=""/></center><br/>
<p id="para"> or </br>
3. Tea made from watermelon (tarbooz) seeds with skin (chhilka) on. The seeds can be black or brown in colour. These can be dried and preserved. Some provision stores selling agricultural requirements, such as seeds, also stock melon seeds. They are marked as â€˜poisonâ€™ or â€˜not for human consumptionâ€™, since they have been treated with pesticides. Therefore, you need to wash and dry them. Then you may safely use them. Grind them dry before boiling, so that the medicine from the skin and the innards is passed into the water. Do not wash the ground seed powder after crushing or grinding.</p>
<center><img id="pill" src="images/kidney5.jpg"  height="300px" alt=""/></center><br/>
<h4 style="color:black;"><b>Quantity</b></h4>
<p id="para">I encourage self-medication. When you are doing it for the first time,you may adhere to the following dosage:</p>
<center><img id="pill" src="images/kidney6.jpg"  height="240px"width="700px" alt=""/></center><br/>
<h3 style="color:black;"><b>Procedure</b></h3>
<p id="para">To make concentrated tea, fill the vessel/pot with just enough water to cover the ingredients and boil any of the three ingredients for 10 minutes. Strain the water and keep it aside. Boil the residue again with fresh water for 10 minutes. Strain it and add it to the water set aside in the previous step. Follow this procedure one more time or until
the mixture begins to lose colour. This indicates that the ingredient has no more medicine left in it.<br/>
Let the strained mixture stand for a few minutes so that any sediment present sinks to the bottom of the vessel. Carefully, without any sudden movement, pour the upper layer of the mixture into another vessel, until the sediment at the bottom starts flowing. </br>Stop
and discard this sediment. This procedure, known as decantation,can be used to separate fine residue from the mixture. Cool the strained mixture. The medicine is now ready for use.</p>
<h3 style="color:black;"><b>Dosage</b></h3>
<p id="para">Drink one litre of this mixture 3-4 times or more during the day. The mixture has to be stored in a refrigerator otherwise it will get spoiled. It can be stored in the refrigerator for a maximum of a day or two. If refrigerated, it may coagulate (thicken) slightly but its medicinal properties are not affected. If you cannot drink the cold liquid, then you may warm it to your taste.</p>
<h3 style="color:black;"><b>Benefits</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>Dissolution of kidney stones</li>
<li>Glowing face, better skin tone with shining and  reduced dark circles below the eyes</li>
<li>Improved haemoglobin levels</li>
<li>Old accumulated toxins expelled from the kidney and blood</li>
<li>Relief from backache and body pain</li>
<li>Improved sleep quality</li>
<li>No more bed wetting and prostrate problems</li>
<li>Higher energy levels</li>
<li>Many more...</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="color:black;"><b>Frequently asked questions</b></h2>
<h4 style="color:black;"><b>How much quantity of corn silk (maize-hair) should a patient take?</b></h4>
<p id="para">I encourage self-medication. You can arrive at the best suitable quantity and frequency for your body through experimentation.Sometimes corn silk tea causes very mild pain in the stomach (3% of patients). Do not take any medicine and bear the mild discomfort. The pain will subside without any medication in about an hour or two. This is caused due to hyperactivity of the nephrons during the cleansing process and is no cause for concern. Parsley and watermelon seeds do not cause any pain but their cleansing effect is also lower.</p>
<h4 style="color:black;"><b></b>Can we store the tea, as prepared above, in a refrigerator?</h4>
<p id="para">Yes. It is alright to store the mixture in a refrigerator for two-three days. Warm it if you wish, at the time of drinking it.Temperature does not play any role in the effects of the medicine in the treatment.</p>
<h4 style="color:black;"><b></b>What is the best time to do Kidney Cleanse?</h4>
<p id="para">Kidneys get an opportunity to function more efficiently when the stomach is empty and the body is most relaxed in a lying down condition. This happens after midnight. I keep a litre of corn-silk (or any of the other option) tea near my bedside at night. If I happen to get up by chance at 2-4 am I drink this and go back to bed. This procedure results in the best effect for me.</p>
<h4 style="color:black;"><b></b>How much quantity do you take for yourself ?</h4>
<p id="para">When I started this treatment 10 years ago, I used to take 500 grams of fresh corn silk or 50 grams of dry corn silk or 500 grams of parsley or 100 grams of watermelon seeds each day, for five days. Now I take 50 grams of dried corn silk or 500 grams of parsley or 200 grams of watermelon seeds with skin for one day every month. This procedure makes about two litres of medicinal tea.</p>
<h4 style="color:black;"><b></b>Can I use all the three ingredients, i.e. parsley, corn silk and watermelon seeds together?</h4>
<p id="para">No. They are to be taken separately. Any one of them is good enough for the treatment. You may use another option after a few days.</p>
