<p id="para">Quite simply, the “G” stands for Generation, as in the next generation of wireless technologies. Each generation is supposedly faster, more secure and more reliable.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:27px;color:black">The latest 5G –<br/>
5G will make communications so fast they become almost real-time, putting mobile internet services on a par with office services</h2>
<ul>
<li style="color:black;font-size:18px;"><b>1G –</b> A term never widely used until 2G was available. This was the first generation of cell phone technology. Simple phone calls were all it was able to do.</li><br/><br/>
<li style="color:black;font-size:18px;"><b>2G – </b>The second generation of cell phone transmission. A few more features were added to the menu such as simple text messaging.</li><br/><br/>
<li style="color:black;font-size:18px;"><b>3G –</b> This generation set the standards for most of the wireless technology we have come to know and love. Web browsing, email, video downloading, picture sharing and other Smartphone technology were introduced in the third generation. 3G should be capable of handling around 2 Megabits per second.</li><br/><br/>
<li style="color:black;font-size:18px;"><b>4G – </b>The speed and standards of this technology of wireless needs to be at least 100 Megabits per second and up to 1 Gigabit per second to pass as 4G. It also needs to share the network resources to support more simultaneous connections on the cell. As it develops, 4G could surpass the speed of the average wireless broadband home Internet connection. Few devices were capable of the full throttle when the technology was first released. Coverage of true 4G was limited to large metropolitan areas. Outside of the covered areas, 4G phones regressed to the 3G standards. When 4G first became available, it was simply a little faster than 3G. 4G is not the same as 4G LTE which is very close to meeting the criteria of the standards.</li><br/>
<li style="color:black;font-size:18px;">The major wireless networks were not actually lying to anyone when 4G first rolled out, they simply stretched the truth a bit. A 4G phone had to comply with the standards but finding the network resources to fulfill the true standard was difficult. You were buying 4G capable devices before the networks were capable of delivering true 4G to the device. Your brain knows that 4G is faster than 3G so you pay the price for the extra speed. Marketing 101. The same will probably be true when 5G hits the markets.</li><br/><br/>
<li style="color:black;font-size:18px;"><b>5G –</b> There are rumors of 5G being tested although the specifications of 5G have not been formally clarified. We can expect that new technology to be rolled out around 2020 but in this fast-paced world it will probably be much sooner than that. Seems like a long ways away but time flies and so will 5G at speeds of 1-10Gbps.</li><br/>
