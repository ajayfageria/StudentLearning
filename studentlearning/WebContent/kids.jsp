<h1 style="color:#0000FF ">How to teach kids about Money ?</h1><br/>
<center><img id="pill" src="images/kids.jpg"  height="450px" alt=""/></center><br/><br/>
<p id="para">The old and gold concept – The piggy bank is the best idea to introduce money and saving to a child. When you use a clear jar, they see the money growing. This will do the two things – Why money is important in life and how it can grow.<br/><br/>

In my views, one more thing we need to teach kids that – Money doesn’t bring happiness but everyone still need it to live a quality and health life.<br/>
<h3 style ="color:black">Here are some basics tips –</h3>
<ol>
<li style="color:green;font-size:17px;">Use a clear jar to save. </li>
<p id="para">The piggy bank is a great idea, but it doesn’t give kids any visual. When you use a clear jar, they see the money growing. Yesterday, they had a dollar bill and five dimes. Today, they have a dollar bill, five dimes and a quarter! Talk through this with them and make a big deal about it!</p>
<li style="color:green;font-size:17px;">Set an example.</li>
<p id="para">Little eyes are watching you. If you’re slapping down plastic every time you go out to dinner or to the grocery store, they will eventually notice. If, at the end of every month, you and your spouse are arguing about money, they’ll notice. Set a healthy example for them, and they’ll be much more likely to follow it when they get older.</p>
<li style="color:green;font-size:17px;">Show them that stuff costs money. </li>
<p id="para">You’ve got to do more than just say, “That pack of toy cars costs $5, son.” Help them grab a few dollars out of the jar, take it with them to the store, and physically hand the money to the cashier. This simple action will do more than just a five-minute lecture.</p>
<li style="color:green;font-size:17px;">Show opportunity cost.</li>
<p id="para">That’s just another way of saying, “If you buy this video game, then you won’t have the money to buy that pair of shoes.” At this age, your kids should be able to weigh decisions and realize that each decision has a consequence.</p>
<li style="color:green;font-size:17px;">Give commissions, not allowances.</li>
<p id="para">Don’t just give your kids money for breathing. Pay them commissions based on chores they do around the house like taking out the trash, cleaning their room, or mowing the grass. This will help them understand that money is earned—it’s not just given to them.</p>
<li style="color:green;font-size:17px;">Stress the importance of giving.</li>
<p id="para">Once they start making a little money, be sure you teach them about giving. They can pick a church, a charity or even someone they know who needs a little help. Eventually, they’ll see how giving doesn’t just affect the people they give to, it affects the giver as well.
</p>
<li style="color:green;font-size:17px;">Give them the responsibility of a bank account.</li>
<p id="para">By the time your kid is a teenager, you should be able to set them up with a simple bank account if you’ve been doing some of the above all along. This takes money management to the next level, and it will prepare them for (hopefully) managing a much heftier account balance when they get older.</p>
<li style="color:green;font-size:17px;">“Help” them find a job. </li>
<p id="para"> Teenagers have plenty of free time—fall break, summer break, winter break, spring break. If your teen needs money (and what teen doesn’t need money?), then help them find a job. Who knew that working was a great way to make money?</p>
<li style="color:green;font-size:17px;">Teach them the danger of credit cards.</li>
<p id="para">As soon as your kid turns 18, they will get hounded by credit card salesmen—especially once they’re in college. If you haven’t taught them why debt is a bad idea, they’ll become another credit card victim.</p>
